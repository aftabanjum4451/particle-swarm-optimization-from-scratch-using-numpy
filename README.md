# particle-swarm-optimization
Partials swarm optimization (PSO) is a global numerical algorithm inspired by birds foraging. In PSO the particle migrates towards the direction of a combination of their former velocity personal best and global best and update its position. In this work, the particles are the weight vectors, and their values are randomly created. For the evaluation of these particles, they are inserted into the neural network and calculate their fitness values. PSO has shown robustness and efficiency in finding global optima.
